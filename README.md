# Fitness_Tracker
## Description
```
Tracking you workouts during exercise can be a hassle.
Walking around with a pencil and a book to record can be inconvenient.
This application will be a bridge to get over those obstacles.
Just in the name of the workout, the amount of weight used,
the amount of repetitions, the time it took to complete
and if cardio, the distanced travelled.
The information will be stored and tracked to compare.

As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
